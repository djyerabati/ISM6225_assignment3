                <p>
                    The project is about finding the list of available fuel stations and fuel types in the given region. This includes biodiesel, compressed natural gas, ethanol, electric charging, hydrogen, liquefied natural gas, and propane station locations. Search is used to list all the fuel stations available for a given fuel type in an area. Using zipcode as search criteria we can find out the available gas stations near by. We are using <span><a href="https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/transportation/alt-fuel-stations-v1/all/#json-output-format">API link</a> </span>  for our projcet to retreive the information.The git hub link is <span><a href="https://github.com/djyerabati/ISM6225_assignment3">Github link</a> </span>
